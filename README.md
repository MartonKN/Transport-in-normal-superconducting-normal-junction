About the project:

This Mathematica code was run on the Harvard cluster to obtain the conductance of a normal-superconducting-normal junction, see M. Kanasz-Nagy et al., "Anomalous Conductances in an Ultracold Quantum Wire", Physical Review Letters 117, 255302 (2016), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02509.pdf.

The physical system we considered here was an ultracold atomic realization of a nano-wire (D. Hussmann et al., "Connecting strongly correlated superfluids by a quantum point contact", Science 350, 1498 (2015)). We were interested in how much current and spin current flows through it when there is a bias voltage applied to the two sides of the sample. 

This looks like a very simple question. However, the ultracold atomic realization was realized in a parameter regime where the usual nanowire experiments haven't gone so far, and it found a very strange behavior. Based on decades of experimental and theoretical work on quantum wires, the expectation was that the conductance of the wire would be at most twice the conductance quantum. However, the experiment found much larger values than this. Furthermore, this value could be tuned by changing the interaction between the atoms.

The interaction between the atoms was very large, and combined with the effect of the confining potential, made the wire superconducting, whereas the surrounding gas was in the normal phase, creating a so-called normal-superconducting-normal junction.
