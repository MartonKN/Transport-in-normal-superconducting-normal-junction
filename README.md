# Transport-in-normal-superconducting-normal-junction

This Mathematica code was run on the Harvard cluster to obtain the conductance of a normal-superconducting-normal junction, see M. Kanasz-Nagy et al., "Anomalous Conductances in an Ultracold Quantum Wire", Physical Review Letters 117, 255302 (2016).

The physical system we considered here was an ultracold atomic realization of a nano-wire (D. Hussmann et al., "Connecting strongly correlated superfluids by a quantum point contact", Science 350, 1498 (2015)). We were interested in how much current and spin current flows through it when there is a current
